# HoneyBadgerMPC Applications
This directory contains experimental applications using HoneyBadgerMPC, some
tutorials and an experimental SDK to develop applications that integrate with
Ethereum.

**Contents**
* [`asynchromix`](asynchromix/): A message mixing application coordinated by a
  Solidity Ethereum contract.
* [`asynchromix2`](asynchromix2/): The original asynchromix application
  revisited and implemented with the experimental SDK, dockerized, and with a
  Vyper-based smart contract.
* [`auctions`](auctions/): A volume matching prototype.
* [`sdk`](sdk/): A toolkit to support the development of applications which
  use Ethereum to orchestrate the multiparty computations.
* [`tutorial`](tutorial/): Examples demonstrating how one can use
  HoneyBadgerMPC to develop applications.
