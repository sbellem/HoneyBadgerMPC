# HoneyBadgerMPC Applications
This directory contains experimental applications using HoneyBadgerMPC, some
tutorials and an experimental SDK to develop applications that integrate with
Ethereum.

**Contents**
* `asynchromix`: A message mixing application coordinated by a Solidity
    Ethereum contract.
* `asynchromix2`: The original asynchromix application revisited and
    implemented with the SDK, dockerized, and with a Vyper-based smart
    contract.
* `auctions`: A volume matching prototype.
* `sdk`: A toolkit to support the development of applications that use
    Ethereum to orchestrate the multiparty computations. 
* `tutorial`: Examples demonstrating how one can use HoneyBadgerMPC to
  develop applications.
